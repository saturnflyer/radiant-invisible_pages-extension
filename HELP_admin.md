You can set pages to be `invisible` to hide them from the main page index.

This feature may be useful if you are migrating older content from another site
structure where you have many pages directly under the home page and you want 
to keep the page management interface clean and simple.

Your Invisible pages may be found under the "Invisible Pages" tab, or if you
have [Dashboard](http://ext.radiantcms.org/extensions/40-dashboard) installed,
you'll find them on your dashboard.

You should be aware that if you set a page to be `invisible`, then it and *all
of it's children* will disappear from the page index and you will only find that
particular page listed as Invisible in the interface, but not it's children.
