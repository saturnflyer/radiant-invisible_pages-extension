You can use the `Invisible` page type to hide pages from the main page index.

This feature may be useful if you are migrating older content from another site
structure where you have many pages directly under the home page and you want 
to keep the page management interface clean and simple.

Your Invisible pages may be found under the "Invisible Pages" tab, or if you
have [Dashboard](http://ext.radiantcms.org/extensions/40-dashboard) installed,
you'll find them on your dashboard.
