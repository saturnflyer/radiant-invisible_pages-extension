= Invisible Pages

Invisible Pages was developed for dealing with migrated content from another
system to allow older content to continue living at it's normal URL. The 
design of this extension assumes that you have some content that may be directly
under your Home page, but you don't want the Radiant interface to have so many
pages on the index. Invisible Pages will keep your interface clean.
